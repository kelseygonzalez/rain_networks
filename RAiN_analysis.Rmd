```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

##### Define conditional installer function #####

loadpackage <- function(x){
  for(i in x){
    #  require returns TRUE invisibly if it was able to load package
    if( ! require(i, character.only = TRUE )){
      #  If package was not able to be loaded then re-install
      install.packages(i, dependencies = TRUE)
    }
    #  Load package (after installing)
    library(i, character.only = TRUE)
  }
}


##### Load packages #####

loadpackage(c("tidyverse",
              "extrafont"))


##### Prepare environment #####

### Load fonts ###
loadfonts()

### Read in file ###


##### Define themes #####

main_theme <- theme_light() + 
              theme(
                text = element_text(size = 12, family = "Merriweather Sans"),
                plot.margin = unit(rep(1, 4), "cm"),
                axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(15, 0, 0, 0)),
                axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(0, 15, 0, 0))
                )




```


### To Do

* Check Small stuff for angles  
  
* Sample descriptives: Age, race, gender, SES, ...  
* Overall distribution of tie numbers  
* Distrubtion of activation instances (overall, per type)  
* Rate of match: Activation ties v. "important ties"
* Differences in tie numbers: age, gender, race, SES  
* Differences in activation instances: age, gender, race, SES  
* Differences in rate of match: age, gender, race, SES
