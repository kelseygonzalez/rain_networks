I listen to her when she has problems and console her when she is missing Mom or has disappointments in life.,My sister is very moody and I don't know from interaction to interaction how she will take something.  She is jealous of me but is also proud of me and one of my biggest cheerleaders.,"It was a spontaneous problem with a new camper.  We called Bob to come give his advice on how to fix the leaky roof.
